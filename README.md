A gameplay build on catching balls.

It's made with Processing 4.3 - 4.4.7, which runs on Java.

This is my first game on GitHub, which I will keep updating.

Here are some controls and features:

    -   It has W A S D and Arrow controls;

    -   Also you can find, that here exist Bonuses and Curses (will be changed in the future);

    -   The game has black and white themes: Change on Black or White with keys "B" and "L" (will be changed in the future);
                                                                                           UPDATE: You can change using "T".

    -   Using CMB you can pause the game;

    -   You can run from following curse;

Made for fun by me.
